    <description>This release fixes some issues, notably a problem occuring while exporting as pdf (again...) using pdfcrop. This release is close to the 2.0.7 release because of the Debian feature freeze that will occur soon.</description>

    <title>latexdraw 2.0.7 available</title>

	  <description>This release fixes the issue that did not allow the export as pdf documents on Windows. By the way on Windows, to export as pdf using pdfcrop you need a perl interpreter installed such as strawberryperl (http://strawberryperl.com/). About the problem concerning a text that contains special characters (for instance the ampersand character), latexdraw will not escape these characters for two simple reasons: 1) a text shape in latexdraw must be formatted in latex since latexdraw is not an interface to latex as lyx. 2) If we escape special characters, how will we be able to use these special characters, for instance to create a tabular?</description>

	  <description>Finally! latexdraw 2.0.3 is just released and brings a great (in my opinion) feature: the ability to export a drawing as pdf and ps using your latex distribution. To sum up, a latex document, containing your drawing, is created and compiled into a pdf or a ps document. You can then insert it into your main latex document as a picture (pstricks packages are no more needed and the pdflatex command can be used).<br/>
This release also fixes some problems for more information) and the Italian localisation is now available!</description>

    <title>Need help to translate :p</title>

	  <description>If you speak Spanish, Italian, German, Japanese, and so on, you can help to translate latexdraw in your language. Such help can be a correction of a translated string or the translation of untranslated strings. The process is simple: to make translations you just need to create an account on launchpad and to set your language(s). Then you can translate latexdraw (and any program which is on lauchpad such as Ubuntu, Gnome,...). See https://translations.launchpad.net/latexdraw/. If you find that a translation is not correct, you can modify it too. </description>

	  <description>2.0 is now released, but certainly the most important release (for me) will be the 2.1. This future version will complete the work began in 2.0, such as the rewrite of the graphical library and of the undo/redo manager. Almost all of the original code has been rewritten in order the have a stout framework to easily implement more PSTricks and graphical stuffs. Because of that, the final user will see only minor changes. But after 2.1, 2.2 will return to provide PSTricks, LaTeX and graphical features such as maybe the pgf export, and some requested features.</description>

	  <description>To facilitate the translation of latexdraw, we test since a month the translation platform of launchpad. Thanks to it, everone can easily translate the program without any pressure of us :p. To make translations you just need to 
	  create an account one launchpad and to set your language(s). Then you can translate latexdraw and any program which is 
	  on lauchpad (Ubuntu, Gnome, ...). See https://translations.launchpad.net/latexdraw/. If you find that a translation is not correct, you can modify it too.

A lot of minor improvements have been implemented, see the release note for more informations.</description>
